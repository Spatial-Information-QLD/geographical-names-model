The name K'gari comes from the creation story of the island, which has been passed down orally for generations between the traditional owners of the surrounding land and waters, the Butchulla People.

K'gari is the name of the white spirit that was sent down from the sky by the god Beeral, to help his messenger Yindingie make the land and seas that are home to the Butchulla People.

To fully understand the origins of the proposed place name of K'gari, the following two texts retell the creation story in its traditional context, along with artwork that is used when passing this cultural knowledge on between generations: (1) K'gari: the Creation of Fraser Island authored and illustrated by Nai Nai Bird (2019) and published by Cengage; and (2) Legends of Fraser Island authored by Olga Miller and illustrated by Nai Nai Bird (1994) and published by Rigby Heinemann.
