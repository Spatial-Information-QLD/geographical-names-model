== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines only three Classes and one Property but reuses many Classes and Properties from other models. Where it does, basic details of, a reference to that Class or Properties' definition via `rdfs:isDefinedBy`, and a scope note about using it in this model are given.

| Property | Value

| IRI | `:GeographicalName`

| Is Defined By | This model
| Subclass Of | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/cn/CompoundName[`cn:CompoundName`]
| History Note | Specialised from <<CNM>>'s Compound Name class
| Expected Properties | <<hasCompoundedName>>  <<isNameFor>>, <<value>>, <<additionalType>>, <<hasNamePart>>, <<hasLifecycleStage>>, <<hasPronunciation>>

[[GeographicalObject]]

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `:GeographicalObject`

| History Note | Specialised from <<GEO>>'s Feature class, as used in <<CNM>>
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissible GeographicalObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Geographical Objects of almost anything.
| Required Properties | <<additionalType>>: Instances of this object _MUST_ indicate a value for <<additionalType>> with a value taken from a controlled vocabulary, such as _Geographical Object Categories_ in the section <<Supporting Vocabularies>>
| Expected Properties | <<hasGeometry>>, <<hasNamePart>>
