====
Data to be validated with this validator _MUST_ include the data of the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gn-part-types[Geographical Name Part Types] vocabulary as well. This ensures that name parts in data can be confirmed to be included in the vocabulary.

Inclusion can be achieved by merging the vocabulary with data before validation.
