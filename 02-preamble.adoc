== Preamble

=== Abstract

A Semantic Web data model of geographical names, sometimes called place names, information. It caters specifically for Australian & New Zealand's naming needs.

[NOTE]
This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future geographical naming needs and is a development of the Place Names ontology <<PNO>> made for ICSM and should be used in its place.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variety of namespaces. Prefixes for these namespaces, used throughout this document, are listed below.
