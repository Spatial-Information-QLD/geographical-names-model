== Supporting Vocabularies

This model depends on several vocabularies to give specific values for certain theming - general classification - and sub-typing properties.

The vocabularies are all independently-published and governed Knowledge Graph artifacts and do not record any relation to this model in their own data.

The vocabularies' details are given in the table below.
